# Capstone_Project

## Background

The project had two main parts. The first was a developer portfolio webpage giving some basic information about myself, a list of services I provide and some (fictitious) testimonials. It also had to include a portfolio section with a link to the second part of the project, the JavaScript application described below.

## The JavaScript Project

The purpose of this project was to enable the user to create a list of meals from the Meal DB API and then confirm whether or not they wanted to go ahead with their order. The object was mainly to practise using asynchronous functions and session storage. Communication between the application and the user took place by means of prompts and alerts. When the user clicks the link from the developer portfolio page mentioned above, they page which starts giving the prompts as soon as the page loads. The user is first asked to enter a main ingredient (e.g. chicken, rice, tomatoes etc.) after which the programme will select a random meal from the list of results delivered by the API and add it to session storage. The user will then be asked whether the order is complete and if they want to continue ordering. If yes, they will be asked to enter another ingredient and so on until they decide not to continue ordering. At that point, they will be presented with a list of their orders and asked if they want to complete any orders that are marked as uncompleted.
